![battle](output/battle_visualization.png)

Legend:
[0: 'Beyond the Wall', 1: 'The Crownlands', 2: 'The North', 3: 'The Reach', 4: 'The Riverlands', 5: 'The Stormlands', 6: 'The Westerlands']

### Visualization 2 :
Visualization of character deaths gender-wise
![battle](output/deaths_visualization.png)

Legend:
[0: 'Female', 1: 'Male']
We can see that male and female who are alive are generally grouped together and those allegiances are relatively same.

### Visualization 3 :
Visualization of the prediction and popularity data gender-wise
![battle](output/prediction_visualization.png)

Legend:
[0: 'Female', 1: 'Male']
This dataset is not so different from the above dataset except with additional information. Mostly the visualization remains same with some modulation relative to the popularity data.
